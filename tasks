# create better animation for button hover - add icon with transition
add a click animation aswell?

# Saving state for users?

# What is going in the menu

# Look at top performing apps

I saw that the highest rated app, views only one category at a time on mobile. Which would reduce page size, 
The user can move to view different categorys
Theres a quick add task function too, where less felds are required 
There is a "date" input field too
It syncronizes across all devices
the abiility to add bullet points to each task (sub tasks)
