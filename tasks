# Completed Tasks
Create a new column to house completed tasks
Add a new state to task object "completed" set to false by default
Add a new button on the task, which marks the task as complete
Once marked as complete the task will move from its current category to completed
Make the completed column look different from the rest of the columns

# Add "Remaining characters" + "Title required for editng category"

# create better animation for button hover - add icon with transition
add a click animation aswell?

# Saving state for users?
