## Application Description

Taskify is a task list react web application which allows users to fill in a short form to display their tasks.
A user starts off by creating a category to organise and group their tasks.
After creating a category the user can then start adding their tasks, each task can then be marked as complete, editted or deleted.

## Objective

Taskify will be a mobile responsive application, it will have a beautiful modern and minimalistic user interface and allow the user to switch between light and dark mode.
Taskify will allow users to create, delete, and edit categories as well as create, delete, edit and complete tasks.
An off screen menu will be available to allow users to navigate the application.
Each category will have its own page where the user can view a simplified interface of tasks in that category.
The default page of Taskify will be an overview of all categories and tasks.
There will be a guide page to illustrate how to use the application.
I will get feedback on my application and make adjustments if needed.
I aim to create this application in 30 days working part time.

## How to navigate this project

-   Handling dynamic user generated links [CategoryTemplate](https://github.com/Jason-Smith-Code/taskify/blob/main/src/routes/CategoryTemplate.js)
-   Building the menu [Menu](https://github.com/Jason-Smith-Code/taskify/blob/main/src/components/menu/Menu.js)

## What was my Workflow

-   **[x] Research to-do applications** <br>
    Researched mobile & desktop applications which handle task lists, I made notes of layout and features.

-   **[x] Write up the idea of the project** <br>
    Made a list of features i wanted to include in my application from the research. I created a priority list, marked the most important tasks, and the rest were bonus objectives if I had enough time.

-   **[x] Brain storm Project Title** <br>
    Made a list of all words associated with the project subject, experimented with combining those words together, forming a final list potential titles. Gathered opinons about that list and picked the most popular one.

-   **[x] Decide on colour palette for the theme** <br>
    Coolors.co is a fantastic App to choose colours for a theme, testing combinations and contrast decided to go with purple hues and picked some cold and warm variations to separate foreground and background.<br>
    You can see my colour theme [here](https://coolors.co/69009e-9e0091-ff00b1-c2a5bc-c1e9f1).

-   **[x] Create a wireframe of Taskify** <br>
    Used wireframing tool [FIGMA](https://www.figma.com/) to plan out my application.<br>
    You can see the results of that work [here](DOWNLOAD LINK TO PDF PLAN)

-   **[x] Use github for version control** <br>
    Set up repository on github, and accessed it locally to start work using git commands to regularly add, commit, and push changes to the repository.

-   **[x] Install packages** <br>
    I had an idea what packages I was going to work with based on the features I wanted to include. Working with React, Jest for testing, redux toolkit for state management, react router and any additional libraries were installed later in the project.

-   **[x] Setup file structure** <br>
    For this project I used create-react-app, I re-organised the file structure and began adding javascript files.

-   **[x] Implement Layout and theme** <br>
    Working from the wireframe I began to build the layout of the application then apply the colour theme.

-   **[x] Implement state management (Redux toolkit)** <br>
    I love redux and prefer to use redux-toolkit to simplify the process of managing the state of the app, allowiing easy access of state to any file and great for scaling when adding more features.

-   **[x] Implement forms for adding tasks and categories**<br>
    Using redux, I created the 2 main forms which acted as the user control point of this App, allowing the user to build their own user interface of tasks and categories. I had to implement some restrictions to avoid a form being submitted with empty strings, and also applied a cap on how many characters could be used for the title.

-   **[x] Implement forms for editting tasks and categories** <br>
    Realising users could make mistakes when adding a task or category, I had to have some functionality in place to allow the user to make changes.

-   **[x] Implement all task and category features** <br>
    Creating, editing, deleting categores. Creating, viewing, editing, deleting and completing tasks. These are the core features of this application.

-   **[x] Implement React Router** <br>
    The main interface became cluttered when full of categories and tasks, which also made the mobile view to much of a scrolling hike. To solve this I created category pages using react router, this allowed me to have a simplified interface where the user could observe tasks from a specific category, reducing the amount of content on screen.

-   **[x] Build the menu** <br>
    I built an off screen menu which will contain links to the main overview, guide, and a dynamic list of categories. It will also be a place to acommodate functions for clearing data.

-   **[x] Create template for category pages** <br>
    Since the user is generating the content in the form of category titles, I had to use those titles to create unique pages in Taskify, I had to eliminate spaces in the title string, replaced them with "-", and also prevent a user from submitting a form with a category title that already exists.

-   **[x] Add a Light / Dark mode** <br>
    Realising that the theme may not cater for everyone's taste, I chose to add a dark version which also maintained the colour scheme of the app.

-   **[x] Create guide page** <br>
    I wanted to explain the process of each feature so that users could have a reference point if they were unsure. The guide is located in the menu, it contains a description of each feature accompanied by an image, and an icon explanation.

-   **[x] Implement persisting data** <br>
    I chose to work wth local storage, but feel that having a user login, and saving the the state of Taskify to a user account would be a better solution, so that the user could access their tasks on another device. This would require having a server, to store user data on which is why I went wth local storage. I added user storage as a bonus objective to complete at a later date.

-   **[x] Implement a "clear data" button** <br>
    Allows users to have a fresh start by wiping the entire state, deleting all categories and tasks, a warning and confirmation is required to prevent accidental loss of state.

-   **[x] Test application** <br>
    I used React testing library with Jest, it's my first time using these both to fully test an application, I chose to do all my testing in one go as I felt that a longer duration of testing would help me get a better understandng of how to implement testing.
    The objective was to test the application from the perspective of how a user would interact with the app, and what they would expect to see when using each and every feature. Ideally, I would be creating my test files and then building the app to the specification of the test files, which is how I intend on approaching my next application, I feel much more confident with testing now.

-   **[x] Add Mobile, tablet and desktopp optimisation** <br>
    I want the application to look great on all mobile, tablet and desktop, I used a mobile first css approach.

-   **[x] Create a build and deploy to github pages** <br>
    To showcase this application, I will use github pages as its free and easy to setup.
