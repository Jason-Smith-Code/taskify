## Application Description

Taskify is a task list react web application which allows users to fill in a short form to display their tasks.
A user starts off by creating a category to organise and group their tasks.
After creating a category the user can then start adding their tasks, each task can then be marked as complete, editted or deleted.

## Objective

Taskify will be a mobile responsive application, it will have a beautiful modern and minimalistic user interface and allow the user to switch between light and dark mode.
Taskify will allow users to create, delete, and edit categories as well as create, delete, edit and complete tasks.
An off screen menu will be available to allow users to navigate the application.
Each category will have its own page where the user can view a simplified interface of tasks in that category.
The default page of Taskify will be an overview of all categories and tasks.
There will be a guide page to illustrate how to use the application.
I will get feedback on my application and make adjustments if needed.
I aim to create this application in 30 days working part time.

## How I worked on this project

-   Researched to-do list and task managing applications on both desktop and mobile
-   Made a list of features i wanted to include
-   Brainstormed ideas of what the application could be called
-   Used wireframing tool [FIGMA](https://www.figma.com/) to plan out my application
-   Set up repository on github and access it locally
-   Install Libraries
